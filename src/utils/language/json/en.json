    "col-content-1": "When someone buys an NFT from the creator, they obtain ownership in the sense that it becomes their property. An NFT is a digital certificate of ownership representing the purchase of an asset, traceable on the blockchain. If someone tries to sell the asset as their own, they will not be able to produce the NFT which in itself is the legal proof of ownership. This NFT is transparent on the blockchain and can be traced to the original owner.",
    "col-content-2": "Transactions; One of the advantages of cryptocurrency transactions is that they are one-to-one affairs, taking place on a peer-to-peer networking structure that makes “cutting out the middle man” a standard practice. This leads to greater clarity in establishing audit trails, less confusion over who should pay what to whom, and greater accountability, in that the two parties involved in a transaction each know who they are.",
    "col-content-2,2": "Asset Transfers; The cryptocurrency blockchain can be described as resembling a “large property rights database,” which can on one level be used to execute and enforce two-party contracts on commodities like automobiles or real estate. But the blockchain cryptocurrency ecosystem may also be used to facilitate specialist modes of transfer.",
    "col-content-2,3": "More Confidential Transactions; Another advantage of cryptocurrency is that each transaction you make is a unique exchange between two parties, the terms of which may be negotiated and agreed in each case. What’s more, the exchange of information is done on a “push” basis, whereby you can transmit exactly what you wish to send to the recipient and nothing besides that.",
    "col-content-2,4": "Transaction Fees; There may be some external fees involved if you engage the services of a third-party management service to maintain your cryptocurrency wallet, but another one of the advantages of cryptocurrency is that they are still likely to be much less than the transaction charges incurred by traditional financial systems.",
    "col-content-2,5": "Easier International Trade; Though largely unrecognized as legal tender on national levels at present, cryptocurrencies by their very nature are not subject to the exchange rates, interest rates, transactions charges, or other levies imposed by a specific country.",
    "col-content-2,6": "Individual Ownership; Perhaps the greatest of all advantages of cryptocurrency is that unless you’ve delegated management of your wallet over to a third party service, you are the sole owner of the corresponding private and public encryption keys that make up your cryptocurrency network identity or address",
    "col-content-2,7": "Adaptability; There are currently over 1200 unique cryptocurrencies or altcoins in circulation worldwide. Many are quite ephemeral, but a significant proportion have been created for specific use cases that illustrate the flexibility of the cryptocurrency phenomenon.",
    "col-content-2,8": "Strong Security; Once a cryptocurrency transfer has been authorized, it can’t be reversed as in the case of the “charge-back” transactions allowed by credit card companies. This is a hedge against fraud which requires a specific agreement to be made between a buyer and seller regarding refunds in the event of a mistake or returns policy.",
    "col-content-3": "There is no way of preventing a token value from decreasing. The token price is based on the intrinsic value of the underline LynKey ecosystem which includes the spending capabilities within the Everland resort and property business. The price is determined by the market and its demand. There is always the risk of a token decreasing in value.",
    "col-content-4": "The benefit of holding a LYNK token is that the token value is based on the utility value of resort tourism, purchase services within the ecosystem also affords you the opportunity to to take advantage of discounts that are made available to token holders, and the opportunity to exchange tokens for NFT’s representing areal value experiences, timeshare, licence for resort properties.",
